## Problem Statement

### A. KPI's / Report Requirement:
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we propose creating a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions for improved patient management and service optimization.

(1) Patients Visit Record:
- Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER monthly/yearly.
- Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to understand patterns over time, such as peak days or seasonal trends.
- Breakdown patients visit by age-group

(2) Average Wait Time:
- Calculate the average waiting time of patients before being attended to by a medical professional.
- Use a sparkline to show monthly fluctuations and identify dips with higher wait times that may require operational adjustments.
- Determine the average wait time by age-group and patient race

(3) Patient Satisfaction Score:
- Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a monthly basis to evaluate the quality of service provided.
- Present a monthly trend using a sparkline to identify dips in satisfaction and correlate them with age-group and patient race.

(4) Patients Referred/Walk-in:
- Percentage and number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER.
- Identify departments with high referral rates that might require additional resources.

(5) Gender Analysis
- Visualize patient distribution by gender.

(6) Racial Demographics and Age Distribution:
- Analyze patient data by race and group them into 10-year age intervals.
  
(7) Department Referrals:
- Analyze referral trends across different departments.
